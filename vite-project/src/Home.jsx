            <b>SWEEP</b> (Solid Waste Echelon Embedded Planner) is a web-based application for designing a Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) 
            management system. Through SWEEP, a user can choose locations for each node in an <b>echelon</b>, input the land and 
            size configuration cost of facility/container, and generate a MSW management system based on the input values. 
            The resulting MSW management system is obtained by solving a “Multi-Echelon Location Routing problem” 
            using <b>Gurobi</b>, which yields the optimal configuration of the MSW management system.
            
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
            The structure of a MSW management system includes multiple <b>echelons</b> that represent different levels of 
            waste collection in an area. The first echelon is dedicated to the sources of waste, which represents 
            households, offices, hospitals, restaurants, or other entities that generate waste. The second echelon 
            includes the possible locations where the <b>containers</b> can be placed that store the waste collected from 
            sources of waste through <b>collection agents</b> such as trucks, tractors, among others. The cost incurred in 
            establishing a container involves <b>land cost</b>, and <b>size configuration cost</b> which is based on the capacity of 
            the container. The locations in echelon third and onwards are labelled as facilities which represent 
            processing centers, transfer stations, or storage facilities. Similar to the second echelon, the costs 
            incurred in establishing the facilities include land cost, and size configuration cost.
